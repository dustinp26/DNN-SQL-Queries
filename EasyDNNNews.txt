// view all articles that are older than 3 months and have 0 views
SELECT ArticleID, Title, PublishDate, NumberOfViews
FROM EasyDNNNews
WHERE NumberOfViews = 0 AND PublishDate < DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())

// Delete all articles that are older than 3 months and have 0 views
DELETE FROM EasyDNNNews
WHERE NumberOfViews = 0 AND PublishDate < DATEADD(month, -3, GETDATE())

// Prevent Duplicate Tags from being imported from RSS import on Easy DNN News
#How It Works:

The trigger is set to fire before every insertion into the EasyDNNNewsTagsItems table.
It will check if the ArticleID and TagID combination already exists in the table.
If the combination is found, it prevents the insertion, thus avoiding the primary key violation error.

#Steps to Implement:
Run the SQL Trigger Query:

Open your SQL management tool (like SQL Server Management Studio).
Paste and execute the following query:
// Start SQL 
CREATE TRIGGER trg_PreventDuplicateTags
ON dbo.EasyDNNNewsTagsItems
INSTEAD OF INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dbo.EasyDNNNewsTagsItems (ArticleID, TagID, DateAdded)
    SELECT i.ArticleID, i.TagID, i.DateAdded
    FROM inserted i
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM dbo.EasyDNNNewsTagsItems 
        WHERE ArticleID = i.ArticleID AND TagID = i.TagID
    );
END;
// STOP SQL 

#Verify the Trigger:

After running the query, the trigger will be in place and will intercept any new insertions into the EasyDNNNewsTagsItems table.
You can verify the trigger was created successfully by running the following query to list all triggers on the table:

// Start SQL 
SELECT * FROM sys.triggers WHERE parent_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.EasyDNNNewsTagsItems');
You should see trg_PreventDuplicateTags listed as an active trigger.
// STOP SQL 
#Monitor Future RSS Imports:

The next time an RSS feed is imported and attempts to insert a duplicate tag, the trigger will prevent it from being added and prevent the primary key violation error.

#Testing the Trigger:
You can test it by manually attempting to insert a duplicate entry into the EasyDNNNewsTagsItems table. The insertion should be blocked by the trigger.

INSERT INTO dbo.EasyDNNNewsTagsItems (ArticleID, TagID, DateAdded)
VALUES (61640, 87, GETDATE());  -- Replace with actual values
If the combination (61640, 87) already exists, the trigger will prevent this insertion from occurring.
